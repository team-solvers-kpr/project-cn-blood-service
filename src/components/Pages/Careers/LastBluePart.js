            Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts from
            within. We are dedicated to creating an organizational culture where
            employees and volunteers can bring their whole selves to work and
            engage and contribute in ways that are most meaningful to them. We
            aim to reflect the diversity of Canadians and exemplify a culture of
            inclusion where all employees have equitable opportunities to
            succeed and contribute. To support an equitable and inclusive
            culture, we have Employee Resource Groups for Black, Indigenous, and
            People of Colour (BIPOC), employees with disabilities, LGBTQ+
            employees and a womenâ€™s leadership network.
