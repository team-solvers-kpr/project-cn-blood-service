          Canadian Blood Services is a not-for-profit charitable organization
          that operates independently from government. Created through a
          memorandum of understanding between the federal, provincial, and
          territorial governments, we opened our doors in 1998. Our funding
          comes primarily from the provincial and territorial governments, and
          we are a registered charity that accepts financial donations.

          Canadian Blood Services is one part of Canada’s broader network of
          healthcare systems and is the only national manufacturer of biological
          products funded by Canada’s provincial and territorial governments. We
          provide blood, plasma, as well as transfusion and stem cell registry
          services, on behalf of all provincial and territorial governments
          (excluding Quebec). Our national transplant registry for
          interprovincial organ sharing and related programs extends to all the
          provinces and territories. We have a unique relationship with
          Hema-Québec, the provincial blood system operator that provides
          products to patients and manages Quebec’s stem cell donor registry.
          Our two organizations work closely to share blood products in times of
          need, and we collaborate regularly to share information, insights, and
          data.

                        In November of 1997, Justice Horace Krever tabled the
                        final report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry on the
                        Blood System in Canada in the House of Commons. That
                        same year federal, provincial and territorial
                        governments enacted a memorandum of understanding that
                        would shape a new, national blood authority for the
                        country.
