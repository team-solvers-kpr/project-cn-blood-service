We ensure Canadian patients have reliable access to safe, high-quality blood, plasma, stem cells, and organs and tissues. To do this, we undertake a broad range of activities in four areas:</p>

                  </a>
                  We collect plasma from volunteer, unpaid donors in Canada. We retain some of this collected plasma to meet the transfusion needs of Canadian patients, but most is shipped to contract manufacturers who use a process called fractionation to create plasma protein products. We distribute approved plasma protein products — derived from our own plasma in addition to the finished product we purchase — to hospitals in Canada (excluding Quebec) to treat patients with immune disorders and diseases such as hemophilia.

                  We operate a stem cell program that supports better outcomes for patients living with any of the more than 80 diseases and disorders that can be treated with stem cell transplants. We collect cord blood and manufacture stem cells through our cord blood bank. We operate a robust national registry of potential adult stem cell donors and participate in an international network of donor registries. We provide human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing services to ensure the best possible matches between those willing to donate stem cells and those who need them.

                  We manage a national transplant registry for interprovincial organ sharing and related programs for organ donation and transplantation. Working with partners across the organ and tissue donation and transplantation (OTDT) community, we develop and share leading practices, provide education resources and collaborate on new ways to share data on the performance of the OTDT system in Canada.

   To support these activities, as well as the advancement of transfusion and transplantation science and medicine in Canada and around the world, Canadian Blood Services conducts a wide range of research and development activities and participates in research led by others. Through these efforts, we help to translate new knowledge, processes and technologies into the manufacturing environment. Our research and development work also supports problem-solving in the blood supply chain, contributing to improvements in quality and efficiency. We support professional education and public awareness activities related to transfusion and transplantation and share our knowledge and expertise with our healthcare partners, stakeholders and funders.
