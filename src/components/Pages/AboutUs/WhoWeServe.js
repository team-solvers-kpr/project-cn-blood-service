Every choice we make is guided by a focus on the ultimate goal of excellent health care: safe, effective and accessible products and services that patients can rely on to improve their health and well-being.</p>
   <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4 text-gray-600"> 
   Our ability to meet that goal relies on the relationships of trust we build with donors. Only through their generosity and dedication can we meet the needs of patients across Canada and — for stem cell recipients — around the world. We are deeply committed to safeguarding donors’ health, and constantly seek new ways to enhance their experience at every point where they interact with us throughout the donation process.
